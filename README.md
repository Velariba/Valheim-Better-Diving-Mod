# Better Diving by Main Street Gaming
This is a fork of the Valheim Diving Mod by MLIMG/Easy_Develope. Special thanks go to MLIMG for creating the original mod. Since development has ceased on the original mod, I have created a fork to continue development and implement bug fixes. 

Like this mod? Development requires a lot of coffee. Support me by buying me a coffee!

## How It Works
- Uses built-in Valheim keybinds and works with custom keybinds and gamepads as well
- While swimming, press the crouch button to enable diving mode
- Diving mode can be cancelled by pressing the crouch button again if near the surface
- While diving is enabled, look in the direction you want to dive and hold your forward movement button (W on keyboard)
- While diving, the Left, Right, Up, and Down movement buttons (WASD on keyboard) can be used to swim in each direction as well
- To return to the surface, look up toward the surface of the water and hold your forward movement button (W on keyboard)
- Diving mode will be automatically cancelled when the player returns to the surface of the water
- While on the surface with diving mode disabled, the player will automatically rest and slowly regain stamina when not in motion (based on the players velocity)
- Large waves can hinder the players ability to rest in water
- The player will gain a Diving skill while diving
- The players oxygen bar drain rate is determined by the Diving skill
- Swim faster by holding the Run button
- Faster swim speed and stamina depletion are determined by the players Swim skill
- Stamina is depleted faster while fast swimming above water
- Oxygen is depleted faster rather than stamina when fast swimming underwater
- Many options can be customized via the config file
- Config entries under the `Server config` and `Server config - Water` sections are enforced by the server
